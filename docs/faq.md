#### How do I use this component?

This component is useless by itself and acts onyl as a host for other components. Hence it should be used only in two cases:
- You are trying to install a .NET component that requires `foo_dotnet_component_host`.
- You are trying to develop a new .NET component.

#### How do I install a .NET component?

1. Open the `foobar2000` preferences dialog (click `File`>`Preferences` or use the `CTRL+P` keyboard shortcut).
1. Select the `Components`>`.NET Components` page.
1. Either click the `Install...` button and locate the component archive, or simply drag it on to the list.
1. Click `OK`. You will be prompted to restart foobar2000 in order to load the newly-installed component.
1. Click `OK` again to restart.
